      hi! this is my portfolio, which i look forward to populating. im not really sure what is going to be on this, but we shall see. <br> 
      i hope to make this portfolio look like an old blog, back when the internet was really bare bones. 
      i want to take that idea and upgrade it a little, but still give off that same aesthetic. <br> <br>

      i swear it's really really cool <br>
      i used to use this website in middle and high school when i was bored, and i found it again for this class. 
      <br> yesterday when i was using the "really really cool" link i realized Miley Cyrus released Bangerz when she was 20. <br>
      im 20. <br>
